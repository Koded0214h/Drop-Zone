## 🌿 **Project Title**: _Grazely_ (feel free to rename it)

### 🎯 **Project Goal**

To provide farmers and herdsmen with real-time, location-based information about areas with high vegetation for grazing, by leveraging satellite data, AI, and geolocation services.

---

## 🧠 **Core Idea**

- Utilize satellite imagery (e.g., from Google Earth Engine or Sentinel) and vegetation indexes like NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to analyze areas with rich vegetation.
    
- Display vegetation heatmaps on a web interface and a mobile app.
    
- Allow users to check areas nearby or search for specific regions.
    
- Include community features like reporting grazing conditions and water availability.
